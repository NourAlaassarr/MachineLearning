## Banknote Authentication

The Banknote Authentication project focuses on classifying banknotes as genuine or forged based on features such as variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy. The classification task is performed using Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

## Diabetes Prediction

The Diabetes Prediction project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measures such as glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, etc. The prediction is made using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification

The MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification project involves classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the famous MNIST dataset. Two different approaches are used: Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Loan Prediction

The Loan Prediction project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various features such as applicant income, loan amount, loan term, etc. The classification task is performed using Decision Trees.

## Decision Tree Classification on Drug Dataset

The Decision Tree project demonstrates the use of Decision Trees for classification tasks. It includes examples such as the Banknote Authentication and Loan Prediction projects.
